                        <span>A. We don't support presentation uploads yet. Please upload your presentation to a public site such as SlideShare or Google Docs and use that link in your talk's description.</span>

                        <span><b> Q. I am a speaker/volunteer at the conference. Do I need to buy a ticket?</b><br></span>
                        <span>A. Yes. At BlockchainCon, everybody buys tickets. Even the event organizers buy tickets. Your ticket helps keep the event affordable for all.</span>

                        <span><b> Q. Will the Internet and WiFi setup be good enough for a large crowd? Should I get a datacard?</b><br></span>
                        <span>A. We try really hard to arrange good Internet at the venue. Most of the times it is adequate. But the unpredictable amount of usage during the event sometimes causes some problems. So it is fine if you donâ€™t carry a data card, but there is no harm in being prepared for the worst.</span>
